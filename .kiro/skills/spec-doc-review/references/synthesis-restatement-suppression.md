# 3.9 Suppress Restatements in Residual Concerns and Deferred Questions

This is a **cold-path reference** for the synthesis pipeline. Load only when any persona output carries non-empty `residual_risks` or `deferred_questions`.

---

Persona outputs carry `residual_risks` and `deferred_questions` arrays alongside `findings`. After the actionable-tier set is finalized (post-3.7 routing), personas often re-surface the same substance in their residual/deferred arrays — the persona's own finding and the persona's own residual concern are about the same issue. Rendering both sections verbatim inflates the output with restatements that carry no new signal.

For every `residual_risk` and `deferred_question` across all persona outputs, check against the finalized actionable-finding set (findings at confidence anchor `75` or `100`, plus FYI-subsection findings at anchor `50`). Drop the residual/deferred item if either of these holds:

- **Section-and-substance overlap.** The residual/deferred item names the same section as an actionable finding AND its substance fuzzy-matches the finding's `title` or `why_it_matters` (shared key nouns/verbs indicating the same concern).
- **Question form of an actionable finding.** A deferred question whose subject is directly answered by or obviated by an actionable finding's recommendation. Example: actionable finding "Motivation cites no real incident" → deferred question "Is there a concrete triggering event?" — the finding already raised this; the question restates it interrogatively.

Do NOT drop residual/deferred items that introduce genuinely new signal (a concern or question the actionable findings do not touch). When in doubt, keep — this pass is for obvious restatements, not borderline calls.

Run this pass on the merged set across all personas. Record the count dropped as a Coverage footnote line when non-zero: `Restated: N (residual/deferred items suppressed as duplicates of actionable findings)`. Omit the footnote when N is zero.
