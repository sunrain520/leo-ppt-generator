## Base Gate

Reuse the existing Requirements Readiness Gate by reference. Do not copy its full prose and do not introduce a second evidence enum.

The base dimensions are:

- Clarity & Non-ambiguity
- Evidence & Inference provenance
- Traceability & Coverage
- Testability
- Boundary integrity
- Planning-invention & Handoff readiness

## PRD-Specific Lens

Run checks by pack. Always run the core pack; run conditional packs only when their trigger is present. This is a prompt economy rule, not a weaker quality bar.

For create/refine when a PRD artifact path exists, running `.kiro/skills/spec-prd/scripts/finalize-prd-artifact.js <prd-path> --inputs <input-path>` is required before this lens can emit a new `ready-for-planning` producer claim; `--inputs-from-frontmatter` is acceptable when `source_inputs:` / legacy `prd_input:` already lists the same locatable inputs. Validate-mode exception: use `--check-only` and receipt verification only. A validate run never invokes the write-mode finalizer; a missing/stale receipt is reported as current not-ready evidence rather than repaired. The finalize/checker path consumes deterministic `spec-prd-artifact-check.v1` facts such as frontmatter, core-section presence, requirement/acceptance trace gaps, placeholder lines, forbidden `docs/prds/` path, Feature Slice acceptance trace gaps, missing run-local readiness declarations, grill trace absence, input scan status, Requirement Analysis Gate closure through the compatibility `preflight_sweep_closure` declaration, ready receipt freshness, machine-owned section identity, and design-source inventory/read/unread/coverage/accounting declaration gaps. Treat those findings as script-owned facts for this lens; they do not decide semantic readiness by themselves. The checker anchors PRD sections by canonical heading or `<!-- prd:section=... -->` section id; pure localized headings are valid when they carry the matching section id, while machine-owned safety sections must remain locatable before final ready.

The readiness orchestrator must consume declaration findings semantically. If the checker/finalize path reports `clarification_evidence_undeclared`, `clarification_trace_absent`, `write_mode_undeclared`, `can_enter_spec_plan_undeclared`, `preflight_sweep_closure_absent`, `preflight_sweep_closure_blocked`, `decision_card_undeclared`, `decision_card_path_mismatch`, `outstanding_question_closure_undeclared`, `blocking_outstanding_question_present`, `planning_invention_question_present`, `unclosed_owner_question_present`, `design_source_inventory_undeclared`, `design_source_coverage_undeclared`, `design_sources_read_undeclared`, `design_sources_unread_undeclared`, `design_source_unaccounted`, `design_unread_without_owner_acceptance`, `design_partial_coverage_unaccepted`, `open_oq_without_owner_closure`, `how_pushdown_touches_what`, `owner_decision_trace_required_but_absent`, `preflight_closure_contradicted`, `checkpoint_claims_ready`, `input_refs_unavailable`, `input_scan_degraded`, `prd_readiness_declarations_evaded`, `ready_receipt_absent`, `ready_receipt_stale`, `machine_section_identity_missing`, `forbidden_prds_path`, or `finalize_required`, the lens must not return `ready-for-planning`. In create/refine, fill a valid declaration from current evidence and rerun finalize, or keep/degrade to checkpoint, `revise-prd`, `ask-owner`, or `route-out`. In validate, report the finding and proposed write target without mutation; only a separately confirmed refine run may repair and finalize it. For final UI/design-surface PRDs, advisory fact `input_scan_attempted=false` is must-not-ready-until-confirmed. Repeat the finding in closeout.

Closeout must show the finalize/checker summary facts before any planning handoff: finding count, blocking `reason_codes`, producer receipt status, and the LLM-owned `readiness_outcome`. Treat finding count, reason_codes, and receipt status as script-owned facts; treat `readiness_outcome`, `Resolved before planning`, `Still carried`, and whether planning would invent WHAT as LLM-owned judgment above those facts. Do not call source-candidate, assumption, external-research, degraded, or checker-presence-only evidence "confirmed", "ready", or "口径已明确" unless source, owner, or checker evidence supports that exact claim.

Closure-disposition razor (004): see SKILL.md `Closure-disposition razor` for the legal disposition set and evidence requirements (single source of truth). The deterministic checker only reads the declared token and evidence-cell presence (KTD2); it does not adjudicate whether a question is load-bearing or whether an owner answer is genuine. The model has no free non-blocking verdict — `blocks_planning=no` is derived from a disposition, never asserted. Deliberate forgery of an owner answer remains beyond artifact-level proof until host question-receipt / transcript-bound provenance exists.

`placeholder_or_todo_present` and draft/checkpoint `requirement_without_acceptance_ref` / `uncovered_requirements` hits that correspond to an intentional placeholder inside the embedded template skeleton, an explicitly recorded trace gap, or an item deliberately deferred to `Outstanding Questions` are expected advisory noise: record the rationale, do not fabricate an acceptance reference or delete a deliberate trace-gap marker to zero the findings array. This carve-out never releases a final/ready claim: `core_section_missing`, `requirements_row_missing`, `acceptance_example_row_missing`, and `requirement_acceptance_trace_missing` are deterministic exit blockers. Feature Slice trace gaps are already honored script-side, so the advisory scope remains draft/checkpoint authoring rather than a ready-path bypass.

## Observed Failure Details

Load this section when a run is about to write a checkpoint, first durable PRD draft, or ready handoff after shallow grilling.

### Checkpoint-as-escape anti-pattern

Observed in 232726 / 231339 runs: the agent asked one batch of broad scoping questions, received answers on scope/range, then immediately wrote a checkpoint while load-bearing interface, architecture, and dependency OQs remained untouched in the Outstanding Questions table. Claiming `clarification_evidence: asked-owner` in that shape is a violation: `asked-owner` means the owner answered the load-bearing OQs, not that some other questions were asked while the rest were parked.

The legal use of checkpoint is **only** when the owner is genuinely unavailable mid-grill, including true headless/no-reply after a soft-cap offer, or when a large input requires preserving partial context across sessions. In all other cases, each load-bearing OQ must reach a Canonical stop point before the branch may close. "The OQ is a planning-time item" and "the OQ can be clarified in parallel with planning" are not checkpoint justifications; they are the failure mode the closure-disposition razor exists to prevent.

### Direct-write-after-read anti-pattern

Observed in the 2026-06-28 run: the agent read source materials and immediately wrote a PRD without emitting a run-local Decision Card. The observable trigger is reasoning like "directory is empty", "materials are clear", or "writing PRD now" with no Requirement Analysis Gate map, Product Expert Lens ranking, Requirements Grill, or Decision Card carrying `write_mode`, `highest_risk_gap`, `next_action`, and `why planning will not invent WHAT`.

This differs from checkpoint-as-escape: checkpoint-as-escape starts the grill and exits early, while direct-write-after-read skips Phase 1 entirely. Minimum evidence of Phase 1 before the first durable Write is: a Decision Card in conversation, at least one Requirement Analysis Gate field such as `open_decisions` or `next_owner_question`, and for inputs with design refs, multiple sources, or owner-owned gaps, either an owner grill question or a source-resolved gap trace. If none are present, stop before the first Write and run Phase 1 first. `write_mode=checkpoint-prd` does not exempt Phase 1.

### Core Pack

- `current-state provenance` - material current-system claims have evidence tags; user-stated, confirmed-source, source-candidate, external-research, and assumptions are not blended; stale pointers are not presented as confirmed.
- `planning recheck visibility` - material source-candidate, local pattern, code-index pointer, prior artifact, or external/reference claim that planning must confirm before selecting HOW is visible in `Planning Recheck`, `Outstanding Questions`, or readiness closeout. It remains advisory until re-read or re-run.
- `change delta and boundary clarity` - keep/extend/replace/remove/unknown is explicit for material changes, scope boundaries are visible, and priority/degrade/block-release semantics are present when relevant.
- `planning-invention and trace risk` - planning would not need to invent actors, flows, acceptance, scope, priority, or current behavior; core requirements have acceptance coverage or an explicit trace gap.
- `coverage pack adequacy` - when the PRD uses the Engineering Clarification Coverage Pack, read it as LLM-owned handoff evidence, not as a deterministic pass/fail table. The P0 minimum items are `source_authority`, `current_state`, `change_delta`, `requirements_acceptance`, `owner_oq_trace`, and `evidence_refs`; each filled item needs `status`, `source_tag`, and `evidence_ref`, while deferred items need an owner or unblock condition. Missing or weak rows are readiness concerns only when they leave planning to invent WHAT.
- `full coverage triggered adequacy` - when `clarification_risk_tier` is `medium`, `high`, or `regulated`, or when UI-heavy/tool/export-heavy/workflow/contract/mixed-surface signals are present, check the full 16-dimension Engineering Clarification Coverage Pack as a semantic lens: source authority, current state, change delta, requirements/acceptance, scope boundaries, owner OQ trace, stakeholders, interaction/exception, data/compliance/security, NFR/operational, design source, cross-surface consistency, rollout, regression guard, handoff context slice, and supporting evidence refs. Missing rows are not deterministic failures; they become readiness findings only when planning would invent WHAT or consume advisory evidence as confirmed.
- `pre-prd clarification closure` - when PRD authoring/refinement uses Pre-PRD Clarification, every load-bearing branch that could affect planning must reach a legal stop point defined in SKILL.md `Canonical: Four Legal Stop Points` before planning, with `Outstanding Questions` / accepted assumption / blocker cluster / explicit trace gap as the visible residue of an owner-capped or route-out branch. Relentless grilling is the default; a branch with reachable sub-decisions that the owner has not capped is not closed. Each owner question has a named gap, source attempt, PRD write target, and closure state; a run-local shared understanding map is not itself readiness evidence. Include `write_mode` and `clarification_evidence` in this check. `write_mode=ask-owner-first` or `write_mode=checkpoint-prd` cannot be `ready-for-planning`; checkpoint closeout must set `can_enter_spec-plan: no` and name `next_owner_question`. When the owner gives no cap/continue signal (absent/headless, or silent after a soft-cap offer), the only legal outcome is the checkpoint fallback (`pre_prd_clarification_status=checkpoint-blocked`), never a silent `ready-for-planning`. If `clarification_evidence=skipped` or the field is missing while Outstanding Questions or Planning Recheck remain, readiness is at best `revise-prd` or `ask-owner`, and closeout must say clarification did not happen. If `clarification_evidence=headless-degraded-logged`, repeat the degradation reason and downgraded question list. If `clarification_evidence=source-proven-no-ask`, require source refs; without them, handle it as skipped.
- `requirement-analysis-gate closure` - before planning, the Phase 1 Requirement Analysis Gate must have closed or visibly carried the requirement understanding map: Input Inventory, Source Authority Order, Target Surface Anchor, Current-State Summary, Change Delta, Module Map, Open Decisions, Design Coverage, API Coverage, Risk -> PRD Write Target Map, and any triggered Product/Design/Technical Owner Question, Domain-Glossary, Topology-Producer-Consumer, Design Coverage, API/Contract Coverage, or Large Input-Resume gates. When design input exists, Design Coverage means the existing `design_source_inventory` was built in Phase 1 per source / node / state, with `source_or_node`, `read_status`, affected PRD write targets, extracted design WHAT, unread/degraded reason, readiness consequence, and owner-authority-needed conflicts. `preflight_sweep_closure: closed | degraded | blocked | missing` is the lightweight compatibility declaration in `Readiness Self-Check`; it now means Requirement Analysis Gate closure. `missing` or `blocked` cannot be `ready-for-planning`, and checker findings `preflight_sweep_closure_absent` / `preflight_sweep_closure_blocked` are must-not-ready until fixed or downgraded.
- `wording and testability` - vague words such as "等", "相关", "合适的", "更好", and "优化体验" are replaced by verifiable behavior, state, trigger, quantity, or acceptance. INVEST, EARS, and Gherkin-style wording are optional clarity anchors, not scoring rubrics.
- `interaction and exception readiness` - important user-visible entries, state, feedback, confirmation, cancellation, failure, empty, permission, retry, and partial-success cases are covered or intentionally out of scope when relevant.

### Quality Diagnosis Pack

Run this pack when the input is an existing PRD, requirements draft, rough notes being refined/validated as PRD input, or the user asks for deep PRD quality analysis or optimization suggestions.

- `product expert lens fit` - the applied surface/industry/product lens follows the actual target surface, current source evidence, and owner-stated objective; generic checklists are not applied as confirmed project facts.
- `canonical lens reuse` - the diagnosis uses `product-expert-lens.md`'s Product Expert Lens as the quality-dimension source instead of copying a second near-duplicate dimension list.
- `preliminary-vs-final diagnosis` - Preliminary Diagnosis may choose source-resolved compact/L1/L2/L3/L4/L5 expansion, route-out, or blocker posture. Only create/refine Final Readiness Diagnosis after rewrite and closure may proceed to producer finalize; validate may only report whether an existing readiness claim is supported and never emits a new claim.
- `optimization suggestion closure` - major PRD gaps are expressed as `original -> recommendation -> reason -> write target`, prioritized by planning-invention risk. Refine incorporates them or leaves visible blockers; validate reports them without mutation.
- `rewrite integrity` - for refine, the final PRD preserves stable IDs where applicable, separates critique from durable requirements, keeps HOW out of requirements, and does not drop confirmed source evidence, owner decisions, assumptions, or unresolved questions during cleanup. For validate, integrity means artifact bytes and receipt remain unchanged.

### P0 Quality Floor Pack

Run this pack only when the corresponding P0 signal is triggered. Untriggered P0 packs are not missing sections and must not expand compact PRDs by default.

- `problem-outcome closure` - if target user, product problem, desired observable outcome, or value framing would affect planning, it is source/owner-confirmed, labeled as an accepted assumption, or visible in `Outstanding Questions`. Missing load-bearing framing blocks `ready-for-planning`.
- `metrics readiness` - improvement claims that affect acceptance, priority, or release confidence have metric/source/baseline/window when confirmed, or are downgraded to observable signal, assumption, or Outstanding Question. Trigger words include improve, optimize, reduce, accelerate, lower cost, stabilize, prove, preserve, avoid regression, reduce drift/load, and increase coverage. Fabricated target values block readiness.
- `nfr-constraint closure` - triggered security, permission, privacy, compliance, payment/transaction, external API, CLI/runtime, migration, bulk/async/sync, rollout, operational, or user-visible failure constraints are captured as product-level requirements, negative acceptance, data/compliance boundaries, or release/operation readiness. API/database/architecture HOW is not accepted as PRD closure.
- `workflow-skill-runtime quality closure` - when the PRD concerns a workflow, skill, prompt, CLI, eval fixture, contract, or runtime projection change, the `Workflow / Skill / Runtime Quality Signals` lens has been applied and planning-critical quality signals are visible as product-level outcomes: public workflow identity, near-neighbor routing, source/runtime boundary, generated runtime mirrors untouched, eval fixtures advisory-only, source/reference contract tests, runtime projection checks, fresh-source eval status, and downstream consumer compatibility. File edits, exact test code, and implementation sequencing remain HOW.
- `traceability closure` - planning-bound requirements trace to acceptance examples and evidence/source, or carry an explicit trace gap / open question. A load-bearing requirement without AE/evidence/trace-gap closure blocks readiness.
- `owner approval closure` - owner answers applied, accepted assumptions, blocking questions, `Resolved before planning`, `Still carried`, `readiness_outcome`, `planning_would_invent_what`, and final readiness posture are visible in PRD-local sections or closeout summary. A separate approval artifact is not required.

### Feature Slice Pack

Run this pack when `## Feature Slices` is present or when PRD complexity suggests slices should exist.

- `slice identity and trace` - each slice has a stable feature ID, business-readable title, source/evidence, requirement refs, acceptance refs or an explicit trace gap, and a visible mapping to Change Delta or core requirements.
- `business capability boundary` - slices are grouped by product capability/outcome rather than Controller/Service/DAO files, screens alone, or code module partitions.
- `source excerpt preservation` - original PRD text, user claim, or source claim remains visible enough for planning and review to trace why the slice exists.
- `cross-cutting risk visibility` - permissions, rollout, compliance, operational, shared-source, and cross-surface concerns are visible as risk signals or cross-cutting notes, not hidden inside fake feature slices.
- `program-slice boundary` - large slice count, cross-owner scope, or cross-release risk leads to split recommendation or owner confirmation; the PRD does not silently decide program/execution slices.

### Topology Pack

Run this pack for medium/large/mixed-surface, workflow, contract, migration, replace, remove, source-of-truth, generated-runtime, artifact/schema/report, or active-surface changes.

- `topology and surface fit` - when the increment changes capability identity, source-of-truth, workflow handoff, artifacts, contracts, runtime generation, or active product surface, the PRD names the primary topology from `references/evidence-and-topology.md`, applies relevant topology-specific gates, and identifies affected surfaces or explicitly rules them out.
- `producer-consumer and source-of-truth closure` - any changed artifact, schema, report, config, setup fact, generated asset, workflow handoff, template, or mirrored doc identifies producer, authority/freshness, consumers, change effect, current/target source-of-truth, generated mirrors, non-authoritative refs, and conflict rule as needed.
- `negative-space coverage` - high-risk, mixed-surface, workflow, contract, migration, replace, or remove changes include negative examples for what must not be generated, exposed, consumed, widened, or treated as current truth.
- `framing-evidence alignment` - when the Framing Gate identified topology, source-of-truth, producer/consumer, active-surface, or negative-space risk, the final PRD either covers that risk with confirmed/user-stated evidence or records it as an assumption, Outstanding Question, or explicit non-goal.

### Domain And Decision Pack

Run this pack when terminology, domain boundary, source/user contradiction, ownership, permission/state/exception scenario, source-of-truth, or hard product-boundary ambiguity could change WHAT, acceptance, scope, or downstream planning.

- `terminology and contradiction handling` - canonical terms are defined or unresolved terms are in Outstanding Questions; source/user/glossary mismatches are recorded as contradictions, not silently resolved. When `docs/contracts/domain-glossary.md` exists, `.kiro/skills/spec-prd/scripts/check-glossary-drift.js <prd-path>` reports deterministic `avoid_term_used` facts; treat findings as advisory, then fix or record the decision. Hits that land in the PRD's own `Glossary` avoid/alias column or in Evidence/Decision-Note provenance references are expected advisory noise: record the rationale, do not delete the avoid declaration or drift trace to silence the script.
- `owner-question discipline` - unresolved owner questions are limited to decisions that change WHAT, acceptance, source-of-truth, scope, terminology, actor/flow/state, exception, permission, release, or another standard PRD write target; repo-discoverable facts are not asked as product questions, every owner question closes or narrows a named gap with a PRD write target, low-value questions are stopped, and broad question clusters route to refine/doc-review instead of being hidden in planning.
- `domain-grill and decision-note adequacy` - load-bearing terminology, domain boundary, contradiction, ownership, permission/state/exception scenario, source/code contradiction, or hard product-boundary ambiguity has either been resolved through source-first evidence plus a requirements scenario grill, recorded as a labeled assumption, moved to `Outstanding Questions`, or escalated to `grill-with-docs` integration; material decisions use PRD-local `Decision Notes` with `question`, `recommended_answer`, `source_tag`, `chosen_answer`, `consequence`, and `deferred_reason` when applicable.
- `deep requirements grill closure` - actor, flow, state, exception, scope, acceptance, permission, release-slice, terminology, or decision-intersection branches from Pre-PRD Clarification or `grill-with-docs` integration each reach a legal stop point in SKILL.md `Canonical: Four Legal Stop Points`. Grilling is relentless by default; "the next question would only expand scope" or "does not affect the current release slice" reorders questions, it does not stop a branch. A branch ends without a Canonical stop point only via `route-out` (anchor missing / broad discovery / non-adjudicable). Any load-bearing branch with reachable sub-decisions that has not reached a Canonical stop point — including one the owner has not capped — blocks `ready-for-planning`.
- `context/adr topology adapter boundary` - existing `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, project glossary, and `docs/adr/**` provide advisory evidence only. PRD-local Glossary / Decision Notes / Evidence And Assumptions / Scope Boundaries remain the planning handoff source; project-level files remain unchanged in default, Lite, triggered-grill, and validate runs.
- `context/adr artifact mode boundary` - readiness never requires project-level topology when PRD-local closure is complete. Promotion is candidate-only; an ADR candidate still requires hard to reverse, surprising without context, and a real tradeoff, plus the common qualification fields. Missing promotion does not block planning.

### P1 Conditional Pack

Run this pack only for triggered conditional signals. It is not an all-section checklist.

- `stakeholder-actor closure` - when Admin, Backend, CLI/DevTool, Mixed surface, permission, approval, producer/consumer, or downstream-consumer signals are present, beneficiary, operator, admin, downstream consumer, and owner are distinguished enough that planning will not invent roles.
- `design-evidence closure` - when screenshot/design-link/exported design context/page/interaction input is present, `design-source-evidence.md` External Evidence Interface has been consumed or explicitly deferred. Readiness checks the resulting PRD write targets and Planning Recheck residue, not a copied design WHAT extraction list. If input contains design-source refs but the PRD does not account for them (`design_source_unaccounted`), input refs are unavailable/degraded (`input_refs_unavailable` / `input_scan_degraded`), or a final UI/design-surface PRD did not attempt input scanning (`input_scan_attempted=false`), readiness must not return `ready-for-planning`. If Figma/design-source nodes are unread and may affect page structure, state, interaction, acceptance, or scope, readiness must not return `ready-for-planning`; continue reading design evidence or ask owner for the design authority/default. For create/refine, preserve recoverable context with `write_mode=checkpoint-prd` and readiness `revise-prd` or `ask-owner`; validate only reports that checkpoint/refine recommendation and does not mutate readiness fields. When design evidence contradicts product requirements, owner decisions, API/source contracts, source-of-truth, fallback display, analytics, or user-visible interaction in a way that changes WHAT, acceptance, or scope, readiness cannot treat it as `source-resolved`; the only ready path is a bound Owner Decision Trace row for that exact conflict, otherwise `ask-owner` or checkpoint. A degraded design-source path can be ready only when `design_sources_unread`, degraded reason, owner acceptance, and remaining Planning Recheck / Outstanding Questions residue are explicit. A naked `design_degraded_owner_acceptance: true` is not owner evidence; acceptance must bind to an Owner Decision Trace row or checkable `design_degraded_owner_acceptance_ref`. PRD/design-source/source consistency remains a route-out to `spec-app-consistency-audit`.
- `release-slice closure` - when requirement count, goals, mixed surfaces, or release order affect scope/acceptance, the PRD records P0/P1/deferred, owner-confirmed split, or Feature Slices. Feature Slices remain PRD handoff units, not task or implementation units.
- `change-management closure` - for `resume-prd`, existing PRD path, multi-round refine, or new meeting/screenshot/review conclusion input, stable R/AE IDs are preserved and added/replaced/deprecated/needs-confirmation deltas are visible.
- `requirements quality rubric` - when wording quality is material, review each load-bearing requirement using Necessary, Single, Unambiguous, Complete, Feasible, Verifiable, and WHAT-not-HOW. This is a vocabulary for LLM/doc-review judgment, not a numeric scorecard or checker rule.
- `clarification risk tier` - `clarification_risk_tier: low | medium | high | regulated` changes how much review/eval depth is expected. Low can stay compact when source-resolved; high or regulated must visibly close owner decisions, compliance/data/security or money/trading constraints, regression risk, and rollout/backout. Risk tier never relaxes machine receipts or owner-owned blockers.
- `right-size budget` - `intake_mode`, `clarification_budget`, and `review_gate_mode` should fit the work. Compact mode may reduce prose volume but must not skip owner-owned blockers, source/design degraded facts, machine section identity, or receipt verification.
- `interaction analysis` - conflicts, duplicated requirements, hidden assumptions, terminology mismatches, and missing edge cases are either resolved in Requirements / Acceptance Examples / Decision Notes or carried as explicit OQ/Planning Recheck residue. Do not let a checklist self-claim substitute for this review.
- `regression guard` - for bugfix, brownfield, replace/remove, runtime/tooling, or compatibility-sensitive PRDs, unchanged behavior and negative acceptance are visible enough that planning will not accidentally widen scope. Old data, old clients, old commands, old routes, and old permissions are explicitly preserved, migrated, or out of scope.
- `living lifecycle` - when updating an existing PRD or downstream-consumed requirements artifact, lifecycle fields such as baseline, supersedes, amendment, reopened, invalidated, last_validated, invalidation_condition, and downstream_sync_impact are clear. Use `downstream_sync_unknown` instead of claiming sync when affected plans/tasks cannot be verified.
- `supporting evidence refs` - when sources are numerous or authority/freshness varies, `supporting_evidence_refs` or an equivalent index tells planning which refs are product-owned, owner-owned, source-confirmed, design-derived, external, stale, or degraded. This index is advisory unless independently verified by scripts/source reads.
- `handoff context slice` - 当 PRD 较长、mixed 或 high risk 时，检查 closeout 是否按 `prd-output-template.md` 的 canonical Handoff Context Slice 提供足够的下游阅读指针；本 lens 不复制字段表，只判断该 slice 是否减少 planning invention 且没有泄漏 HOW。

### Metrics And Overlay Pack

Run this pack only when the PRD includes goals/metrics, internal workflow/skill/runtime quality signals, or applies a project-local industry/team/legal/compliance/privacy/safety overlay.

- `goal-measurability` - when the PRD includes `Goals / Success Metrics`, each goal is measurable: it has a metric and target value, plus current baseline and measurement window when available, and vague verbs are replaced with an observable definition. This is a standard for stated goals, not a demand to manufacture metrics. When no credible metric source exists, downgrade to an observable definition or move the unproven metric into Assumptions / Outstanding Questions; never fabricate target values.
- `internal-tool quality signals` - for workflow, skill, prompt, CLI, eval, contract, or runtime projection PRDs, observable signals may be behavioral or contract signals such as hot-path load/anchors, boundary drift cases, runtime projection checks, generated mirrors untouched, advisory fixture coverage, fresh-source eval status, and downstream consumer compatibility. They remain PRD outcomes, not task breakdown.
- `project-local overlay check` - triggered legal, compliance, money, trading, data, audit, safety, or privacy boundaries are explicit. If they are not confirmed, keep them in `Evidence And Assumptions` or `Outstanding Questions`.

## Outcomes

Frontmatter `status` is machine-owned once a PRD artifact exists. The LLM may keep a document at `status: draft` / checkpoint while it is still being shaped, but it must not write `status: ready-for-planning` directly; that status requires the producer-local finalize receipt (`readiness_verified_by: check-prd-artifact.js`, current `readiness_prd_hash`, and current `readiness_inputs_hash`). Conversely, a polished document can still return `revise-prd` or `ask-owner`.

When closing a PRD handoff or writing `Readiness Self-Check`, state `readiness_outcome` explicitly using exactly one of:

- `ready-for-planning` - planning can consume the PRD without inventing WHAT.
- `revise-prd` - fix concrete PRD gaps before planning.
- `ask-owner` - ask the source-backed grill question that closes or narrows the named PRD write target.
- `doc-review` - request independent document review when risk is broad or subtle.
- `route-out` - use brainstorm, app consistency audit, plan, debug, or work instead.

Implementation-ready or direct route-out is a route-out/bypass exception, not a hidden compact PRD shortcut. When used, record the reason and why downstream planning or work will not need to invent WHAT.

If the user chooses to continue with assumptions, record the accepted risk in the PRD. Do not hide readiness gaps in the closeout.

Before declaring `ready-for-planning`, run a handoff entropy check: list `Resolved before planning`, `Still carried`, and any remaining WHAT decisions that planning would otherwise have to invent across behavior, scope, affected surfaces, artifact consumers, source-of-truth, negative boundaries, and unresolved framing risks. If any open load-bearing WHAT gap remains unresolved, the outcome is `revise-prd` or `ask-owner`, not ready.

The handoff entropy check must include `write_mode`, `clarification_evidence`, Requirement Analysis Gate closure via `preflight_sweep_closure`, checker findings, PRD-owned owner questions, and Figma/design-source residue. A PRD-owned owner question that can change WHAT, acceptance, data authority, interface availability, fallback display, analytics acceptance, or source-of-truth blocks readiness even if a table says `blocks planning? no`. Planning Recheck is non-blocking only for HOW or integration recheck items after product defaults and acceptance are closed.
