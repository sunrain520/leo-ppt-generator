# PRD Output Template

Load this reference before drafting or materially rewriting a PRD artifact.

This file owns the machine-safe output contract, section identity, and composition order. `SKILL.md` `Template Trigger Map` is the single source of truth for template and overlay selection. Human-facing body templates live under `../assets/templates/`; optional built-in industry overlays live under `../assets/overlays/`. Do not duplicate their body content or routing map here.

## Default Frontmatter

```yaml
---
spec_id: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<slug>
artifact_kind: prd-requirements
target_surface: generic
status: draft
evidence_grade: mixed
source_authority: product-owned | engineering-owned | mixed | unknown
readiness_authority: engineering-owned
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source_inputs:
  - path/to/original-input.md
---
```

Default path: `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<slug>-requirements.md`.

`artifact_kind: prd-requirements` marks a PRD-grade requirements origin that the current host's plan workflow can consume as requirements. Do not create `docs/prds/`.
`source_inputs` lists original PRD/source/design input files that are locatable inside the target repo; omit only when no original input file is locatable, and record that limitation in readiness. The producer-local Stop hook uses this field to pass `--inputs` into finalize/checker so input-side design-source accounting is actually enforced. This field name is a hard contract — the Stop hook reads only `source_inputs:` (or legacy `prd_input:`); alternate names like `origin_docs:` are NOT recognized and cause the hook to extract zero inputs, producing `input_refs_unavailable` + `ready_receipt_stale`. Always use `source_inputs:`.

## Output Shape

Choose the standard PRD output shape after source-first grilling has either closed or explicitly carried the relevant requirement branches:

| Shape | Use when | Default content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bypass` | The request is a clear bugfix, tiny script/docs edit, or implementation-ready task where PRD authoring adds no durable WHAT value. | No PRD artifact; provide an explicit plan/work/debug handoff reason. |
| `compact-prd` | Every relevant branch is already source-resolved (Canonical stop 2) so no owner interview is needed, and there is no broad surface or topology risk. Relentless grilling is still the default — compact is the shape that source evidence earned, not a shortcut past clarification. | Standard core sections with source evidence, acceptance, scope, and assumptions sufficient for planning. |
| `normal-prd` | An ordinary product/system increment needs planning-ready requirements, acceptance, and scope. | Core sections plus triggered surface/domain sections. |
| `topology-heavy-prd` | Workflow, contract, migration, replace, remove, source-of-truth, or mixed-surface changes could leave active surfaces or consumers ambiguous. | Core sections plus topology, surface map, producer/consumer, source-of-truth, negative acceptance, and decision notes as needed. |

The selected shape is run-local authoring posture, not frontmatter, schema, or a second artifact taxonomy.

## Core Sections

Every PRD artifact includes the standard core sections unless it is a route-out/bypass with no PRD artifact:

- `## Summary`
- `## Change Delta`
- `## Requirements`
- `## Acceptance Examples`
- `## Scope Boundaries`
- `## Evidence And Assumptions`

Compact PRDs may omit non-load-bearing conditional detail, but they still need enough evidence, acceptance, and scope boundary for planning. Bypass output writes no PRD artifact.

Keep every core section machine-locatable with either the canonical heading (`## Summary`) or a section id comment immediately before a localized heading, for example `<!-- prd:section=summary -->` followed by `## 需求概述`. Draft/checkpoint core-section gaps remain advisory `template_structure_hint` findings. A final/ready claim fails closed with `core_section_missing`, `requirements_row_missing`, `acceptance_example_row_missing`, or `requirement_acceptance_trace_missing` when a core section is absent, Requirements/Acceptance Examples have no valid row, or an R item has no AE trace. Final-ready machine safety sections such as Outstanding Questions, Owner Decision Trace, Readiness Self-Check, and Design Source Coverage must also be locatable or the checker blocks with `machine_section_identity_missing`.

## Clarification Checklist Display Protocol

Show the selected `clarification_view` and its checklist before or during authoring when it helps the owner see what is being clarified. The checklist is a human-facing display surface: it names likely questions, surfaces omissions, and routes unresolved items into existing PRD sections. It is not a script-owned quality score, not a required heading set, and not a `BLOCKING_REASON_CODES` source.

Resolve the selected view and packaged asset only through `SKILL.md` `Template Trigger Map`; do not recreate the view-to-asset mapping here and do not load every surface template. The selected asset owns its display focus and detailed questions.

## Engineering Clarification Coverage Pack

For P0, include a compact Coverage Pack in `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Readiness Self-Check`, or closeout when the PRD would otherwise hide planning-critical uncertainty. Each row carries `status`, `source_tag`, `evidence_ref`, `deferred_owner`, and `deferred_unblock_condition`. `status=filled` still needs a source tag and evidence ref; otherwise it is only self-claiming prose. Scripts may report deterministic structure facts, but they do not validate coverage-pack semantics.

| coverage item | What it proves for planning |
| --- | --- |
| `source_authority` | Whether product-owned input, engineering-owned source evidence, or a mixed authority trail owns the claim |
| `current_state` | Which current-system facts were confirmed, candidate-only, or unresolved |
| `change_delta` | What is kept, extended, replaced, removed, or unknown |
| `requirements_acceptance` | Which R/AE links are closed and which carry explicit trace gaps |
| `owner_oq_trace` | Which owner decisions or OQs still affect WHAT, acceptance, scope, authority, or defaults |
| `evidence_refs` | Which source/design/owner refs planning must re-read or can treat as confirmed |

For medium/high/regulated risk, UI-heavy, tool/export-heavy, workflow/contract, or mixed-surface PRDs, expand to the full 16-dimension Coverage Pack, the full LLM-owned coverage lens below. This is not a universal template and not a checker gate; use only rows that reduce planning invention and collapse clearly irrelevant rows to `not-applicable` with a short reason.

| full coverage item | What planning needs to know |
| --- | --- |
| `source_authority` | product-owned, engineering-owned, mixed, or unknown authority for each load-bearing claim |
| `current_state` | confirmed current behavior, candidate-only facts, contradictions, and stale evidence |
| `change_delta` | keep/extend/replace/remove/unknown boundaries |
| `requirements_acceptance` | R/AE trace closure or explicit trace gaps |
| `scope_boundaries` | in scope, out of scope, no-gos, rabbit holes, and appetite when risk warrants it |
| `owner_oq_trace` | owner-owned decisions, recommended defaults, accepted assumptions, and unresolved blockers |
| `stakeholders_actors` | beneficiary, operator, admin, downstream consumer, owner, and support roles when distinct |
| `interaction_exception` | states, errors, empty/loading/permission, retry, cancellation, partial success, and failure visibility |
| `data_compliance_security` | privacy, permissions, audit, compliance, money/trading, data sensitivity, retention, and export boundaries |
| `nfr_operational` | product-level performance, reliability, observability, rollout, backout, and support expectations |
| `design_source` | design refs read/unread/degraded, affected PRD write targets, and readiness consequence |
| `cross_surface_consistency` | producer/consumer, source-of-truth, async sync, mixed surface consistency, and allowed differences |
| `release_rollout` | feature flags, gray release, user cohorts, migration, compatibility, and rollback user impact |
| `regression_guard` | unchanged behavior, old data, old clients, old commands, and negative acceptance |
| `handoff_context_slice` | concise source refs, decisions, constraints, trace gaps, and recheck items for `spec-plan` |
| `supporting_evidence_refs` | first-class index of source/design/owner/external refs with authority and freshness |

Suggested row shape:

```markdown
| coverage_item | status | source_tag | evidence_ref | deferred_owner | deferred_unblock_condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

`status` values should stay human-readable: `filled`, `not-applicable`, `deferred-with-owner`, `deferred-with-source-recheck`, or `degraded`. Do not use this table to self-certify readiness; weak rows are readiness/doc-review concerns only when they leave planning to invent WHAT.

## Conditional Sections

Include these only when they reduce planning invention:

- `## Problem Frame`
- `## Current System Snapshot`
- `## Change Topology`
- `## Surface Map`
- `## Producer / Artifact / Consumer`
- `## Source-Of-Truth Resolution`
- `## Negative Acceptance`
- `## Goals / Success Metrics`
- `## Glossary`
- `## Decision Notes`
- `## Actors`
- `## Use Cases`
- `## Interaction Requirements`
- `## Exception Handling`
- `## Data / Compliance Boundaries`
- `## Release / Operation Readiness`
- `## Outstanding Questions`
- `## Planning Recheck`
- `## Feature Slices`

Success Metrics are conditional. When present, each goal should be measurable: metric, target value, and when available, current baseline and measurement window, with leading/lagging type for core goals. If there is no credible metric source, write an observable measurement definition or record the assumption; do not invent target values.

Trigger `## Goals / Success Metrics` when a planning-bound objective says improve, optimize, reduce, lower, accelerate, stabilize, prove, preserve, avoid regression, reduce drift, reduce prompt/runtime load, increase coverage, or similar and that objective affects priority, acceptance, or release confidence. For internal tools, workflows, skills, prompts, and runtime projection changes, acceptable observable signals include hot-path load or anchor count, output-drift or boundary regression cases, source/reference contract coverage, runtime projection or generated-mirror drift checks, eval fixture coverage, fresh-source eval status, and downstream consumer compatibility. When no credible baseline or target exists, write an observable signal or assumption; never invent a numeric target.

Use `## Planning Recheck` only when it prevents advisory evidence from being consumed as confirmed truth. Add it when a source-candidate, local pattern, code-index pointer, prior artifact, or unconfirmed external/reference claim must be re-read or re-run before planning selects HOW. Keep it compact and PRD-local:

```markdown
## Planning Recheck

| item | why recheck | required before | blocks planning? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

`Planning Recheck` must not be used as a parking lot for PRD-owned owner questions. A PRD-owned owner question must not be marked non-blocking Planning Recheck when it can change user behavior, scope, acceptance, data authority, interface availability, fallback display, analytics acceptance, or source-of-truth. Only HOW/integration/source-refresh checks that do not require planning to invent WHAT may be non-blocking.

## Surface Lens Semantics

Follow the canonical selection in `SKILL.md` `Template Trigger Map`. The selected asset owns the detailed surface questions; this contract owns only composition order, machine safety, and the rule that irrelevant templates stay unloaded.

These are surface lenses, not role taxonomies. They ask PRD questions; they do not prescribe implementation units.

For workflow, skill, prompt, CLI, eval, contract, or runtime projection PRDs, apply a run-local `Workflow / Skill / Runtime Quality Signals` lens. Use it to ask whether the PRD names public workflow identity, near-neighbor routing, source/runtime boundary, generated runtime mirror status, advisory fixture limits, contract-test expectations, fresh-source eval status, and downstream consumer compatibility. Persist only the parts that reduce planning invention into existing PRD sections.

## Project-Local Overlays

When a project has local templates, standards, glossary, compliance docs, or industry appendices:

1. Read only the relevant section.
2. Treat it as a project-local overlay.
3. Record which overlay was applied.
4. Ask the current conversation user for confirmation when the overlay suggests legal, compliance, money movement, privacy, or safety implications.

Missing local overlay docs are a graceful absence, not an error and not permission to invent industry rules. Do not treat template industry facts as confirmed project rules; local templates raise questions until source or owner confirmation resolves them.

## Industry Overlay Semantics

When the canonical `SKILL.md` trigger map selects an industry overlay, layer it on top of the surface template. The overlay only raises questions and triggers conditional sections; it never asserts an industry rule as confirmed truth. Consumer-project local overlays remain project-owned and are read only when relevant.

If no industry context is detectable, do not load any industry overlay.

## Product Expert Lens Write-In

`product-expert-lens.md` is the canonical PRD quality-dimension list and downstream-confirmation source. This template consumes its run-local interface; it does not copy the full lens or create a fallback checklist.

Write Lens output into existing PRD sections:

- `claim + evidence/source` supports `Current System Snapshot`, `Change Delta`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, or `Planning Recheck`.
- `gap + PRD_write_target` decides which standard section must be updated or which owner question is worth asking.
- `owner_question_or_assumption` becomes a one-question-at-a-time grill item, an accepted assumption, `Outstanding Questions`, or blocker.
- `closure_state` informs closeout, readiness, and handoff residue.
- `downstream_confirmation_risk` affects question order and handoff priority, not a numeric score or script-owned readiness verdict.

Use `accepted-assumption` only when owner accepted it or source evidence proves it safe. A recommended default without owner/source support stays as `recommended default` and must appear in `Outstanding Questions`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, or `Planning Recheck` with its consequence.

For structured or already-decided inputs, synthesize settled WHAT into standard PRD sections and demote implementation/testing/API/schema/task details to HOW unless they change scope, acceptance, or source-of-truth. Do not introduce a named conversion field map, adapter, issue tracker, or second output artifact.

## Template Composition And Machine Sections

Compose the durable PRD in this order:

1. Apply the Default Frontmatter and output-shape rules from this contract.
2. Use `SKILL.md` `Template Trigger Map` to load the baseline human-facing body and one primary surface asset.
3. Add secondary surface assets only for real mixed-surface changes.
4. Add only the built-in and consumer-project overlays selected by the canonical trigger map and current project context.
5. Append the machine-safe sections below. Human-facing templates must not prefill `status: ready-for-planning`, `readiness_verified_*`, or a ready receipt.

```markdown

## Outstanding Questions

| id | question | PRD write target | owner_status | blocks_planning | closure_disposition | planning_would_invent_what | closure_state | recommended_default/deferred_reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Closure-disposition razor: see SKILL.md `Closure-disposition razor` for the legal disposition set (single source of truth). For this template's evidence shape: a `source-resolved` / `source-backed-non-WHAT-assumption` cell needs a checkable ref (path/URL/`file:line`/anchor), an `owner-answered` / `owner-capped` / `owner-accepted-assumption` row needs a matching Owner Decision Trace row below, and `implementation-only-how-pushdown` needs `planning_would_invent_what=no` (touching interface/permission/scope/source-of-truth/fallback/analytics is a blocking contradiction in a ready PRD). "I judged it a parallel planning-time item" is not a disposition; without a legal disposition the only path is to keep grilling or `checkpoint-prd`.

Vocabulary boundary: `closure_disposition` says why an OQ can be non-blocking; `closure_state` says what remains for handoff. Legal `closure_state` values are `open`, `closed`, `deferred`, or `blocked`. Do not put `owner-accepted-assumption`, `owner-capped`, `source-resolved`, or `implementation-only-how-pushdown` in `closure_state`.

Design/source authority razor: a design-source fact can be `source-resolved` only when it answers a fact without contradicting another product/owner/source contract. If design evidence conflicts with requirements, owner decisions, API/source contracts, source-of-truth, fallback display, analytics, or user-visible interaction in a way that changes WHAT, acceptance, or scope, record it as an owner-authority-needed OQ/Decision Note. It may use `owner-answered` only when Owner Decision Trace binds to that exact conflict and records the actual owner answer; otherwise keep `ask-owner-first` or `checkpoint-prd`.

## Owner Decision Trace

Required when `clarification_evidence=asked-owner`, an OQ is `owner_status=answered|capped`, or closure depends on an owner answer. Each row records the owner's actual decision; the checker verifies the row is structurally present (it cannot verify the answer is genuine — that stays owner-owned). Header alias: `check-prd-artifact.js` `TRACE_HEADER_ALIASES` also accepts `decision` / `决策` as the `question` column header.

| question | owner_answer/source | chosen_answer | PRD write target | consequence | closure_state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Design Source Coverage

Copy this machine field block when any design link, screenshot, exported design context, or design-dependent UI state is present. Keep the field names exact; use `- none` rather than omitting an empty list.

design_source_inventory:
- source_or_node: <explicit input ref, Figma-discoverable node, or design-dependent state referenced by requirements>
  read_status: read | unread | degraded
  affected_prd_write_targets: <Interaction Requirements | Use Cases | Acceptance Examples | Evidence And Assumptions | Planning Recheck | Outstanding Questions>
  extracted_design_what:
  evidence_level: source-candidate/provider_untrusted | confirmed owner/source | assumption
  unread_or_degraded_reason:
  readiness_consequence:
  conflicts:
    - contradicts: <requirement/source/owner/API contract>
      owner_authority_needed: yes | no
      readiness_consequence:

design_sources_read:
- <source_or_node + affected PRD write target + evidence level>

design_sources_unread:
- <source_or_node + unread/degraded reason + readiness consequence, or none>

design_source_coverage: read | unread | partial | degraded | not-applicable
design_degraded_owner_acceptance_ref: <Owner Decision Trace row, checkable owner ref, or none>

Design-source inventory is mandatory whenever design input exists, even when access is degraded or unread. Put unread/degraded refs in `design_sources_unread` with readiness consequence rather than omitting the design source. For create/refine, `partial` or `degraded` coverage can only support `final-prd` when `design_degraded_owner_acceptance_ref` binds to real owner acceptance for that exact residue; otherwise keep `write_mode: checkpoint-prd` and `can_enter_spec_plan: no`. Validate only reports the recommended checkpoint/refine write target and never mutates these fields.

## Readiness Self-Check

write_mode:
clarification_evidence:
preflight_sweep_closure: closed | degraded | blocked | missing
decision_card_highest_risk_gap:
decision_card_next_action: ask-owner-first | checkpoint-prd | final-prd | route-out
decision_card_why_no_invention:
design_source_coverage:
readiness_verified_by:
readiness_checker_schema:
readiness_prd_hash:
readiness_inputs_hash:
first_unclosed_owner_question:
recommended default:
can_enter_spec_plan:
why_not:
```

`preflight_sweep_closure` is the compatibility field for Requirement Analysis Gate closure. It must summarize whether the run-local map from materials to requirement understanding, uncertainty/contradiction points, product/design/technical grill decisions, and PRD write targets is closed, degraded, blocked, or missing. Do not add a second persistent analysis schema to the PRD.

`decision_card_*` fields persist the Phase 1 Decision Card (highest_risk_gap / next_action / why_no_invention) into the artifact so Phase 1 entry is machine-verifiable. `write_mode` doubles as the Decision Card's write_mode element (not redeclared). `decision_card_next_action` 必须与其完全一致；两个有效声明互相冲突时，checker 报告 `decision_card_path_mismatch`。The three `decision_card_*` fields are required when `write_mode=final-prd` or `status=ready-for-planning`; the checker reports `decision_card_undeclared` if any field is missing or empty. `checkpoint-prd` 在仍处于 grill 时只豁免完整性，不豁免显式路径矛盾。

`write_mode: final-prd` plus `can_enter_spec_plan: yes` is LLM-owned final intent, not a receipt. Persist that pair only after semantic closure while frontmatter remains `status: draft`. The `status: ready-for-planning` and `readiness_verified_*` fields are producer-local machine receipt fields: never fill or invent them manually; `.kiro/skills/spec-prd/scripts/finalize-prd-artifact.js` writes them atomically after `check-prd-artifact.js` reports no producer blocking reasons。缺少或 stale receipt 时，check-only 必须阻断 ready closeout claim，但不得仅因 draft 已合法持久化 final intent 就把该 intent 判为非法；write mode 可以生成第一份 receipt。If the PRD is still a checkpoint, keep `can_enter_spec_plan: no` and omit the ready receipt.

Use the selected packaged template asset and project-local overlay to add only the conditional sections the increment needs.

## Authoring Discipline

Use brownfield increment examples, not 0-1 expansion examples:

- vague original -> improved concrete wording -> reason
- replace "等", "相关", "合适的", "更好", and "优化体验" with observable scope, state, quantity, trigger, or acceptance
- product constraints are allowed; implementation units, schemas, exact API fields, database tables, and task breakdown are not
- run the Framing Gate and Evidence Plan from `evidence-and-topology.md` when the input signals removal, migration, workflow/contract change, source-of-truth movement, generated/runtime mirrors, package/docs/test cleanup, or cross-surface scope
- do not print the run-local Framing Gate by default; promote only the parts that reduce planning invention into Current System Snapshot, Change Topology, Surface Map, Producer / Artifact / Consumer, Source-Of-Truth Resolution, Negative Acceptance, Evidence And Assumptions, or Outstanding Questions

### Push-Right Owner Checkpoint (Brief)

Resolve every source-answerable gap first (relentless, one question at a time against repo/docs/API). Defer the irreducible owner decisions to the rightmost checkpoint as a decision ordering/preview Brief, not as a batch question. Each Brief item: `decision | recommended answer | affected PRD write target | what planning would invent if unanswered`. The Brief is run-local (no new artifact); its only durable residue is the trace. Review speed matters — a concise, decision-ready Brief is genuine engagement, a wall of raw draft is not. However, owner interaction still happens one source-backed decision at a time through the platform blocking question tool or `question_delivery=chat-fallback`: ask the current highest-risk item, wait for the reply, write the matching `owner-answered` row in Owner Decision Trace, then continue if another item remains. Do not use one global Brief reply to close multiple `owner-*` OQs.

## PRD Quality Diagnosis And Optimization

For validate mode, diagnose and return a report-only result:

```text
quality_diagnosis: ready | minor-gaps | material-gaps | blockers
evidence_depth:
top_gaps:
rewrite_strategy:
```

Give optimization suggestions as `original -> recommendation -> reason -> write target`. Prioritize suggestions that reduce planning invention: missing current-state evidence, unclear delta, untestable wording, missing priority, missing acceptance, industry/compliance uncertainty, source/user contradiction, or scope creep.

Run checker/finalizer only with `--check-only` or receipt verification. Report current bytes/receipt/readiness facts and semantic gaps; do not write a replacement artifact, a standalone report file, a receipt, screenshots, provider JSON, or runtime assets. If the user asks to validate and fix, show the proposed patch first and re-enter as `refine` only after explicit confirmation.

For refine mode, diagnose before rewriting with the same compact block and suggestions. Then produce the final rewritten PRD using the packaged generic template, the selected surface asset, and triggered sections. Ensure there is no standalone quality report artifact unless the user explicitly asks; put persistent decisions into `Decision Notes`, assumptions into `Evidence And Assumptions`, and unresolved blockers into `Outstanding Questions`.

`not-run` is a run-local decision-card state only; do not emit it in the diagnosis block because an emitted refine/validate diagnosis has run by definition. Do not create numeric PRD scorecards, 0-100 quality ratings, or industry hard-threshold rubrics.

Use two different diagnosis moments:

- `Preliminary Diagnosis` happens after sanitization and source/current-state evidence. It decides input scale, system anchor, how to run Pre-PRD Clarification, whether large-input Map-Reduce is needed, which P0/P1 packs are triggered, and whether to route out.
- `Final Readiness Diagnosis` happens after refine rewrite and closure, or after validate completes its read-only source/check-only pass. It decides whether unresolved gaps still force planning to invent WHAT. Preliminary labels such as `ready`, `minor-gaps`, `material-gaps`, or `blockers` are not final `ready-for-planning`.

If Pre-PRD Clarification ran, feed its results into final PRD rewrite through section-level write targets. Do not leave a detached critique, interview transcript, chunk summary, Map row, Reduce output, or standalone grill report as the durable output.

For a new PRD, keep the shared understanding map run-local until standard-template scope, acceptance, terminology, actor/flow/state, exception, permission, release, and boundary branches are source-resolved, owner-answered, accepted as assumptions, moved to `Outstanding Questions`, blocked, or routed out. Only then write the durable PRD sections. For resume/refine, incremental writes are allowed during clarification, but each write must be visibly confirmed by source evidence, owner answer, or a labeled assumption. Implementation-ready or direct route-out paths must state the bypass reason and the handoff target rather than silently producing a compact PRD.

Rough PRD gap-to-target mapping:

| Gap type | First resolution path | PRD write target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| actor / beneficiary unclear | prior PRD/source-facing entry, then owner | `Actors`, `Requirements`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| flow missing | current routes/commands/docs, then owner | `Use Cases`, `Interaction Requirements`, `Acceptance Examples` |
| state / permission missing | source/tests/roles/contracts, then owner | `Requirements`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Negative Acceptance` |
| exception / failure missing | existing error/empty/retry patterns, then owner | `Exception Handling`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Scope Boundaries` |
| scope boundary fuzzy | prior plans/non-goals, then owner | `Scope Boundaries`, `Decision Notes` |
| decision intersection unresolved | ratified decisions/docs/source, then owner | `Decision Notes`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| term/source contradiction | Domain Grill source-first lookup | `Glossary`, `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions` |
| problem / outcome unclear | owner, prior PRD, product docs | `Problem Frame`, `Summary`, `Goals / Success Metrics`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| metric claim ungrounded | source/baseline lookup, then owner | `Goals / Success Metrics`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| product-level NFR or constraint missing | surface/project overlay, then owner | `Data / Compliance Boundaries`, `Release / Operation Readiness`, `Exception Handling`, `Negative Acceptance` |
| trace gap | PRD rewrite or explicit trace gap | `Requirements`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| cross-chunk duplication or contradiction | Map-Reduce Shuffle/Reduce, then owner if unresolved | `Requirements`, `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| owner closure missing | closeout summary and Decision Notes | `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| design / UX evidence present | extract PRD facts only; app audit remains separate | `Interaction Requirements`, `Use Cases`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Evidence And Assumptions` |
| release or slice ambiguity | owner-confirmed priority/split | `Feature Slices`, `Scope Boundaries`, `Release / Operation Readiness` |
| existing PRD changed | stable IDs plus add/replace/deprecate notes | `Change Delta`, `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions` |
| structured/decided input with embedded HOW | synthesize settled WHAT, demote implementation/testing mechanics | standard PRD sections, assumptions, or planning context |

Large-input Map-Reduce results must enter final PRD rewrite through the same section-level reducers: canonical candidates become requirements or feature slices, supporting refs become evidence, conflicts become Decision Notes / Evidence And Assumptions / Outstanding Questions, and blocker clusters stay blockers. Never treat lossy chunk summaries as source-of-truth.

For oversized, multi-source, long-chain, or resume-risk runs, `large-input-checkpoint.md` may write reduced candidates earlier as PRD checkpoints. Ordinary short PRDs still wait until closure before durable write-in. Checkpoint content uses existing sections and source refs; it never creates a transcript or progress schema.

When the run uses `checkpoint-prd`, write it as a recovery checkpoint, not a final PRD. A checkpoint-prd must include `can_enter_spec-plan: no`, `next_owner_question`, open owner/source gaps, and `write_mode=checkpoint-prd` in `Readiness Self-Check` or closeout. It is not a final PRD and must not be presented as planning-ready. The relentless fallback uses this shape: when the owner gives no cap/continue signal — whether absent/headless or silent after a soft-cap offer (the observable signal is the same) — stop here with `pre_prd_clarification_status=checkpoint-blocked` rather than silently emitting `ready-for-planning`.

## P0 PRD Quality Packs

Run these packs when their trigger affects planning-invention risk or standard-template completeness. If a trigger is absent, keep source-resolved compact PRDs focused and record none/zero only when closeout clarity needs it.

| Pack | Trigger | Write target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem / Outcome Framing Gate | Draft describes functions but lacks target user, product problem, desired observable outcome, or value decision planning would otherwise invent | `Problem Frame`, `Summary`, `Goals / Success Metrics`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| Success Metrics / Measurement Readiness | PRD says improve, optimize, reduce, accelerate, lower cost, stabilize, prove, preserve, avoid regression, reduce drift/load, increase coverage, or similar and the claim affects acceptance, priority, or release confidence | `Goals / Success Metrics`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| NFR / Constraint Pack | Security, permission, privacy, compliance, payment/transaction, external API, CLI/runtime, migration, bulk/async/sync, or user-visible failure signal affects WHAT, acceptance, or release boundary | `Data / Compliance Boundaries`, `Release / Operation Readiness`, `Exception Handling`, `Negative Acceptance` |
| Traceability Matrix | Core requirement will be consumed by planning | `Requirements`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| Review / Approval Closure | Closeout/readiness needs to show owner answers, accepted assumptions, blockers, and planning readiness | `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Outstanding Questions`, closeout summary |

Rules:

- A missing target user/problem/outcome becomes one owner question, an accepted assumption, or an `Outstanding Questions` blocker; 0-1 opportunity discovery routes to brainstorm.
- A metric with source, baseline, target, and window can be written as a metric. Without credible evidence, write an observable signal, assumption, or Outstanding Question. Never fabricate target values.
- For workflow, skill, prompt, CLI, eval, or runtime projection PRDs, write success signals at the behavior/contract level: hot-path anchors or load, route/boundary drift cases, source/reference contract tests, runtime projection checks, generated runtime mirrors untouched, eval fixtures as advisory-only evidence, fresh-source eval status, and downstream consumer compatibility. Do not turn these signals into implementation tasks.
- NFR and constraint content stays product-level: permissions, privacy, compliance, compatibility, rollout, operational readiness, failure semantics, and negative acceptance. API/database/architecture HOW excluded from PRD requirements; implementation mechanisms stay out of PRD requirements.
- Traceability is lightweight: `R -> AE -> evidence/source -> open question`. This is not a schema, scorecard, or mandatory table format.
- Owner closure summarizes `owner_answers_applied`, `accepted_assumptions`, `blocking_questions`, `ready-for-planning`, and `planning_would_invent_what` when those signals exist. It does not create a separate approval artifact.

## P1 Conditional Enrichment Packs

Run these only when the input surface warrants them and the detail reduces planning invention:

| Pack | Trigger | Write target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stakeholder / Actor Alignment | Admin, Backend, CLI/DevTool, Mixed surface, permission, approval, producer/consumer, downstream consumer, or ambiguous user/system/admin wording | `Actors`, `Requirements`, `Use Cases`, `Evidence And Assumptions` |
| Design / UX Evidence Hook | App/H5/PC/Admin, screenshots, design links, exported design context, page description, or interaction-state input | use `design-source-evidence.md` External Evidence Interface to choose `Interaction Requirements`, `Use Cases`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, or `Planning Recheck`; list `design_source_inventory`, `design_sources_read`, `design_sources_unread`, `source_or_node`, `read_status`, PRD write target, evidence level, unread reason, and readiness consequence |
| Prioritization / Release Slice | Many requirements, multiple goals, multi-surface scope, or release order affects scope or acceptance | `Feature Slices`, `Scope Boundaries`, `Release / Operation Readiness` |
| Change Management | `resume-prd`, existing PRD path, multi-round refine, new meeting/screenshot/review conclusion, or changed owner decision | `Change Delta`, `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions` |
| Requirements Quality Rubric | PRD wording is vague, multi-meaning, too broad, mixed with HOW, or hard to test | rewrite Requirements / Acceptance Examples; use Necessary, Single, Unambiguous, Complete, Feasible, Verifiable, and WHAT-not-HOW as review words, not scoring fields |
| Clarification Risk Tier | scope, compliance, money/trading, mixed-surface, migration, runtime, or owner ambiguity affects how deep to clarify | `Readiness Self-Check`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, and triggered conditional sections |
| Living Requirements Lifecycle | existing PRD is updated, superseded, reopened, partially invalidated, or consumed by downstream plans/tasks | `Change Delta`, `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, closeout summary |
| Interaction Analysis | requirements conflict, duplicate, hide assumptions, mismatch terminology, or miss edge cases | `Requirements`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Decision Notes`, `Outstanding Questions` |
| Regression Guard | bugfix, brownfield increment, replace/remove, runtime/tooling, or compatibility-sensitive change | `Scope Boundaries`, `Negative Acceptance`, `Acceptance Examples`, `Release / Operation Readiness` |
| Supporting Evidence Refs | source/design/owner/external refs are numerous or authority/freshness differs | `Evidence And Assumptions`, `Planning Recheck`, closeout summary |
| Handoff Context Slice | downstream `spec-plan` should not re-read the whole PRD to find decisions and trace gaps | closeout summary or `Readiness Self-Check` |

Actor alignment distinguishes beneficiary, operator, admin, downstream consumer, and owner only when the distinction changes WHAT or acceptance. Design evidence loads `design-source-evidence.md` and consumes only its External Evidence Interface, especially `extracted_design_what` and `affected_PRD_write_targets`; the detailed extraction list stays in that reference. Fetched design context remains `source-candidate` / `provider_untrusted` until source/owner reconciliation; unresolved design claims go to `Planning Recheck` or `Outstanding Questions`. It routes consistency audit to `spec-app-consistency-audit`; PRD/design-source/source consistency remains outside `spec-prd`. Release slices are PRD handoff units, never tasks or implementation units. Change Management preserves stable R/AE IDs and records added, replaced, deprecated, or still-unconfirmed deltas instead of silently rewriting old requirements.

`clarification_risk_tier` is LLM-owned and advisory. Use `low` for narrow source-resolved increments, `medium` for ordinary feature changes with owner decisions, `high` for mixed-surface/migration/source-of-truth/runtime or broad release risk, and `regulated` for money movement, trading, privacy, legal/compliance, audit, or safety-sensitive scope. Higher tier increases review/eval depth; it does not bypass owner-owned blockers or machine receipts.

`clarification_budget` and `review_gate_mode` right-size the expression, not the truth requirement. Suggested values:

| field | values | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intake_mode` | feature / bugfix / design-first / requirements-first / quick-compact | why this run entered PRD clarification |
| `clarification_budget` | compact / standard / deep | how much explanatory surface is warranted |
| `review_gate_mode` | self-check / doc-review / fresh-source-eval / owner-review | what review posture is expected before planning |

Living lifecycle fields are optional unless the PRD updates an existing requirements artifact; use `requirements_lifecycle` to name the lifecycle status:

```text
requirements_lifecycle: baseline | supersedes | amendment | reopened | invalidated | archived
supersedes:
reopened_reason:
invalidation_condition:
last_validated:
downstream_sync_impact:
```

Use `downstream_sync_unknown` when affected plans/tasks/artifacts cannot be determined from current evidence. Do not claim downstream sync is complete without direct source or deterministic artifact evidence.

Supporting evidence refs should be indexed when the PRD has more than a few sources:

```markdown
| ref_id | source_type | authority | freshness | consumed_by | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

`source_type` may be `product-prd`, `owner-answer`, `source-code`, `test`, `design`, `external-research`, or `prior-artifact`. `authority` and `freshness` are LLM-owned judgments over evidence, not checker facts.

The handoff context slice is a compact downstream reading map:

对于 long、mixed 或 high-risk PRD，加入最多三个 load-bearing Requirement / Acceptance Example 引用，以及 planning 必须保留的 behaviors。这些内容只是现有 PRD 的阅读指针，不复制完整 requirements，也不包含 implementation instructions。

```text
handoff_context_slice:
- confirmed WHAT:
- top requirement / acceptance refs:
- must-preserve behaviors:
- owner decisions:
- accepted assumptions:
- source refs to re-read:
- unresolved WHAT blockers:
- planning recheck items:
- degraded facts:
```

Do not put implementation steps, file lists, or task sequencing in the handoff context slice; that is `spec-plan` territory.

## Context / ADR Notes

When existing `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, context-specific `CONTEXT.md`, or `docs/adr/**` were read, record the PRD-relevant evidence source and contradiction/decision outcome. Stable terms persist in `Glossary`; hard decisions persist in `Decision Notes`, `Evidence And Assumptions`, or `Scope Boundaries` so the PRD remains sufficient for planning.

In every PRD profile and trigger mode, project-level context/glossary/ADR promotion is candidate-only after PRD-local closure. A qualified candidate records target kind/path, proposed meaning, provenance, applicability scope, a real consumer, reuse rationale, invalidation condition, and `not written by this workflow`. It is not a readiness prerequisite. `grill-with-docs-integration.md` does not change this mutation boundary.

## Feature Slices

Add `## Feature Slices` when the PRD is large, mixed-surface, multi-feature, refine/validate with multiple goals, or otherwise likely to make planning infer feature boundaries. Feature Slices are context and handoff units, not execution units, task packs, program slices, or sub-agent dispatch units.

Use business capability/outcome boundaries rather than code-layer partitions such as Controller/Service/DAO files. Each slice should preserve original PRD text or source claim when available:

```text
feature_id:
title:
summary:
requirement_refs:
acceptance_refs:
source_excerpt_or_claim:
evidence:
candidate_modules_or_source_refs:
risk_signals:
```

Rules:

- no slice without acceptance refs or an explicit trace gap;
- candidate modules/source refs are evidence pointers, not scope authority;
- cross-cutting concerns belong in risk signals or cross-cutting notes, not fake feature slices;
- 3-7 slices is a common healthy range, not a hard rule;
- more than 10 slices should trigger split recommendation or owner confirmation before silent expansion.

For medium, large, mixed-surface, workflow, contract, migration, replace, or remove changes, include topology-driven sections only as needed:

````markdown
## Change Topology

Primary topology: add | extend | replace | remove | migrate | split | merge | policy-change | workflow-change | contract-change

Why this topology matters:

## Surface Map

| surface | current behavior | owner/source | artifact/contract | consumer | delta | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Producer / Artifact / Consumer

| producer | artifact/schema/path | freshness/authority | consumers | change effect | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Source-Of-Truth Resolution

| item | current source-of-truth | target source-of-truth | generated mirrors / non-authoritative refs | conflict rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Negative Acceptance

```text
NA-01
Given <current or future state>
When <implementation or workflow runs>
Then <must not happen>
```
````

These sections are not implementation planning. They define WHAT boundaries so planning does not invent affected surfaces, consumers, or source-of-truth decisions.

## Stable Trace Rules

Preserve existing IDs when refining a draft:

- R / AE / BR / NFR IDs are not reused.
- New IDs continue from the maximum current number.
- Project-local IDs such as `US-*`, `FEAT-*`, or `NFR-*` may be kept as auxiliary trace, but they must map back to spec-first requirements, acceptance examples, scope boundaries, or assumptions.

## Closeout Summary

Every PRD handoff should report:

- Resolved before planning
- Still carried
- planning_would_invent_what
- sections included
- requirement count
- acceptance example count
- priority distribution
- NFR count
- assumption count
- outstanding question count
- planning recheck item count
- uncovered requirements
- feature items without acceptance examples
- current-state claims without confirmed evidence
- finalize/checker finding count
- finalize/checker blocking reason_codes
- producer receipt status
- readiness_outcome

For create/refine when a PRD artifact path exists, run `.kiro/skills/spec-prd/scripts/finalize-prd-artifact.js <prd-path> --inputs <input-path>` before confirmed ready closeout; use `--inputs-from-frontmatter` only when `source_inputs:` / legacy `prd_input:` already lists the same locatable input files, and use `--check-only` for preview. Validate uses only `--check-only` or receipt verification and reports the current state without writing. The finalize/checker path seeds deterministic counts and trace facts before any LLM-owned readiness judgment such as `Resolved before planning`, `Still carried`, and whether planning would still have to invent WHAT. Use `preflight_sweep_closure` to state whether the Phase 1 Requirement Analysis Gate closed, degraded, blocked, or is missing; this is a lightweight compatibility declaration in the existing `Readiness Self-Check`, not a second PRD artifact topology.

The script seeds only the deterministic lines: sections included, requirement count, acceptance example count, priority distribution, NFR count, assumption count, outstanding question count, uncovered requirements, feature-to-R/AE trace gaps, finding count, blocking reason_codes, and producer receipt status. The lines `Resolved before planning`, `Still carried`, `planning recheck item count`, `current-state claims without confirmed evidence`, `readiness_outcome`, and whether planning would still have to invent WHAT stay LLM-owned: the checker intentionally does not and must not compute them, because deciding which sentence is a load-bearing source-candidate recheck item or current-state claim and whether its evidence genuinely confirms is semantic (the script reports `evidence_tags_present` by presence only, not sufficiency).

For `write_mode=checkpoint-prd`, closeout wording must remain non-ready recovery: repeat `can_enter_spec-plan: no`, name `next_owner_question` or the next source question, keep `readiness_outcome=revise-prd` or `readiness_outcome=ask-owner`, and do not recommend planning. A checkpoint may preserve recoverable context, but it is not a final PRD and not a planning handoff.

When `## Feature Slices` is present, or when PRD complexity was explicitly evaluated for slice need, additionally report:

- feature slice count and feature IDs
- feature-to-R/AE trace gaps
- cross-cutting risk count
- split recommendation / owner confirmation status when slice count, cross-owner scope, or cross-release risk suggests program or execution slicing

If gaps remain, do not silently recommend planning. Ask the source-backed grill question that closes or narrows the named PRD write target, record accepted assumptions, or route to document review/refine.

## Lightweight Split Topology

For owner-confirmed oversized initial PRDs, use shared base identity without adding packet infrastructure:

Split summary frontmatter:

```yaml
---
spec_id: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<base-slug>
artifact_kind: prd-requirements
document_role: split-summary
source_prd: docs/brainstorms/<source-or-original>.md
---
```

Child PRD frontmatter:

```yaml
---
spec_id: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<base-slug>
artifact_kind: prd-requirements
document_role: child-prd
child_id: <module-slug>
parent_spec_id: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<base-slug>
source_prd: docs/brainstorms/<source-or-original>.md
split_summary: docs/brainstorms/<split-summary>.md
---
```

The split summary is navigation and boundary context. Implementation planning should normally start from a concrete child PRD, preserving `child_id`, `parent_spec_id`, `source_prd`, and `split_summary` trace.
